x86 MASM 10-Week Condensed College Course CSC-2025 this is the eighth programming assignment

----------

Starting with your string compression program from programming assignment 7 and build a letter frequency table (you MUST use a 26 entry WORD integer array) that counts how many times each letter is used in your compressed string.

Count upper case letters as if they were lower case.

Print out the numbers in this table to the screen starting with the frequency of "a" and continuing to the frequency of "z".

Format the output table with heading letters and the frequency of each letter beneath.

Give the user the option to repeat the program. Make sure that the answer is not case sensitive.

You can use one response to repeat the program and any key to terminate the program.
